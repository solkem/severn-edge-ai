# Severn Edge AI Student Handout (Grade 5)

Name: ____________________   Date: ____________________

## Your Mission
Teach your Arduino to recognize your gestures using Edge AI.

You are building a prototype, not a perfect product.

## 1-Minute Micro-Brief (Do This First)
Circle one choice in each row.

- Mission: `Music Control` | `Game Control` | `Classroom Tool` | `Creative Art`
- User: `Me` | `Partner` | `Teacher`
- Number of gestures: `2` | `3` | `4`
- Success goal: `7/10 correct` | `8/10 correct` | `9/10 correct`

Write your choices:

- My mission: ____________________
- My user: ____________________
- I will train ______ gestures.
- My success goal is ______ / 10.

## Workflow (Do In Order)
Check each box when done.

- [ ] Connect Arduino in Chrome.
- [ ] Preview sensor numbers and complete the mini challenges.
- [ ] Collect at least 10 good samples per gesture.
- [ ] Train your model.
- [ ] Upload model to Arduino.
- [ ] Test with the challenge and record your score.
- [ ] Complete the full Project Brief at the end.

## Data Quality Rules (Very Important)
- Start each gesture from the same position.
- Make each gesture clearly different from the others.
- Keep speed and motion style consistent.
- Re-record low-quality samples.
- Do not unplug your board after upload.

## If Your Model Is Confused
- Collect more samples for the confused gestures.
- Make those gestures more different.
- Retrain and test again.
- Use confidence to decide if a prediction is trustworthy.

## Score Tracker
- Round 1 score: ______ / 10
- Round 2 score: ______ / 10
- Best score: ______ / 10

## Final Project Brief (Do At The End)
Now that you understand Edge AI, answer:

1. What problem does your project solve?
2. Which gestures worked best and why?
3. Where did the model fail?
4. What would you improve next?

## Quick Vocabulary
- Sensor data: numbers from motion sensors.
- Model: pattern-matching brain you train.
- Inference: model making a live guess.
- Confidence: how sure the model is.
- Edge AI: AI running on a device, not in the cloud.
